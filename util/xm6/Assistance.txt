
If you cannot - or will not - install the Visual C++ 2008
Redistributable Package, you can still run XM6 Pro-68k by putting
these files in the same directory as the executable (XM6.exe):

 mfc90.dll
 Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest
 Microsoft.VC90.MFC.manifest
 msvcr90.dll

If you don't trust the files included in this archive,
you may be able to obtain copies from a WinSxS directory,
but they must match the internal manifest exactly.


Also included are some optional but highly recommended files:

 cgrom.dat
 zlib1.dll

Put them in the same directory as the executable.
The DLL can alternatively be installed in SYSTEM32.
