

Overview:

This is a fork of XM6 version 2.05 with a plethora of new features,
the majority of which are user interface or development related.
Please read the change log and reference manual for more details.




Requirements:

 32-bit x86 CPU with MMX (Athlon, Celeron, Duron, Pentium II, etc.)
 Windows 2000 or later (*)
 Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (available on my website)
 DirectX 5 (probably comes installed with any compatible OS)
 CGROM.DAT (optional, available on my website)
 ZLIB1.DLL (optional, available on my website)

* Note that older editions of Windows are no longer supported even
though there is nothing in the code that requires a newer version.
Blame Microsoft.




Installation:

Extract the files from this archive into a suitable directory.
Next try running the main executable (XM6.exe). If it gives you
an error message you probably need the VC redistributable package.
See my website for two options.




Troubleshooting:

- You get a message saying the application configuration is incorrect.

The Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package needs to be installed.
You can get a recent version of it on my website, along with
an alternative package of DLLs that do not need to be installed.


- You get an error message saying you need a new version of Windows.

Time to upgrade! The minimum requirement is allegedly Windows 2000,
although it has only been tested with XP.


- You see garbage where you are expecting glyphs.

CGROM.DAT is missing or corrupt. This file isn't technically
required, depending on the software you're trying to run,
but is highly recommended. You can get a copy on my website.


- Your computer got hacked.

Next time download the executable from the website listed below.




Website:

The following website is the only official place to get this program:

http://mijet.eludevisibility.org/

http://mijet.eludevisibility.org/XM6 Pro-68k/XM6 Pro-68k.html

For security and configuration management reasons I'd prefer people
use one of the above links instead of redistributing this program,
but realistically not everyone is going to cooperate, so I advise
the reader to take a few extra minutes and go get the archive from
the official site if you haven't already done so.

For extra security, type "XM6 Pro-68k" into an Internet search engine
and make sure the top result matches the Web address in this document.
